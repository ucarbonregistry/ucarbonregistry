The Universal Carbon Registry (UCR) and Universal Water Registry (UWR) Standard and Platform is the next-generation model in mining verified non-compliance carbon credits and water credits respectively, from a wide range of green projects. Launched in 2021, the program and registry was conceptualized, designed and co-founded by Mr Kishore Butani and Mr Vihar Pancholi from ground up, and it has gone on and showcased a far more efficient, faster, cheaper and de-centralized carbon and water credits generating ecosystem that rewards climate actions undertaken by every small green project owner aiming to decarbonize the economy or build water resiliance via rainwater harvesting and water conservation projects globally.

The crediting system and the verified credits themselves are designed by Kishore & Vihar to be tokenized on-chain for wider retail investment participation.  Minted carbon and water tokens would typically be ERC-20/ERC-1155 compliant and would be used in Web3 Re-fi plays under the “real-world asset” narrative.

The "tokenization" bridge system, another innovation design by Kishore and Vihar, ensures that each DLT token will automatically be backed 1:1 by an unretired carbon/water credit that is removed permanently from the web 2.0 ecosystem ("unretired") and free to be used/unlocked only on the web 3.0 decentralized application or exchange.
